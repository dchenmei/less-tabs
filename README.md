# Less Tabs

When only the favicons are visible on the tab bar, it can be a nightmare. Browser extension Less Tabs aims to reduce clutter and push users towards more conscious browsing. 

Less Tabs is not a memory management tool. Most computers can handle large amount of tabs before any hiccup. Rather, it is a stress management tool. No more "I will look at it later" mirage, unecessary pressure to look at all the saved tabs, or unforeseen panic attacks when they are gone.

Less Tabs is also a handy productivity tool that allows the user to focus on the tabs (tasks) at hand. 

Note: Currently only supported on Chrome
